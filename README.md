3. After the download has finished, open (double-click) the installer to begin installing the Anaconda Distribution
4. Follow the prompts on the graphical installer to completely install the Anaconda Distribution (The final page is 'Thanks for installing Anaconda3')
5. Open the app called 'Anaconda Navigator' and press the 'launch' button in the 'Jupyter Notebook' box (to open Jupyter Notebook / confirm it was successfuly installed)
<br /><br />

#### Step 2. Create a local copy using the Anaconda Navigator app

1. Go to https://github.com/KevinMMendez/BinderTutorial_Workflow 
2. Press the green 'Clone or Download', and then click 'Download zip'
3. Move this downloaded folder to a suitable directory (by default it is is the 'Download' folder)
4. Open the Anaconda Navigator Application
5. Move from the 'Home' tab to the 'Environment' tab (on the left side)
6. Click import (at the bottom), which opens a box called 'Import New Enviroment'
7. In 'Import New Enviroment', press the 'folder' icon and navigate to the 'environment.yml' file in the folder downloaded in step 2/3.
8. Click Import and wait for the environment to install (note: may take 5-10 minutes)
9. Return to the 'Home' tab
10. Change 'Application on... base(root)' to 'Application on... BinderTutorial_Workflow' (at the top)
11. Press the 'Launch' button under the 'Jupyter Notebook' box
12. Using the Notebook Dashboard, locate the downloaded folder in step 2/3 and open (double-click) on the 'Tutorial1.ipynb'.

#### Step 2. Create a local copy using Terminal / Command Prompt **(Alternative)**
1. Open Terminal on Linux/MacOS or Command Prompt on Windows
2. Enter the following into the console (one line at a time)

```console
git clone https://github.com/KevinMMendez/BinderTutorial_Workflow
cd BinderTutorial_Workflow
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate BinderTutorial_Workflow
jupyter notebook
```

Note: if you recieve the following error, "fatal: destination path 'BinderTutorial_Workflow' already exists and is not an empty directory". You need to delete the 'BinderTutorial_Workflow' folder in that current directory or move to a new directory. This folder can be deleted using Terminal / Command Prompt  with:
```console
rm -rf BinderTutorial_Workflow
```
